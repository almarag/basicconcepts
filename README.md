# Basic Concepts for software development (PHP/.NET)
This project aims to be a non-exhaustive list of basic concepts for the most common things that I get asked on any job interview and as a reminder of the basic concepts for software development.

Changelog:

08/09/2015 - Updated root to include C#. While I primarily intended this project to use PHP, I'm also a C# developer so I'll include some C# examples too.
